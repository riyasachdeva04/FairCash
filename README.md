# Fair Cash

Welcome to **Fair Cash** ‚Äî the app that‚Äôs transforming how companies identify and address gender-based salary disparities. Powered by AI,  and real-time employee feedback, Fair Cash uncovers hidden biases in your workplace, offering actionable insights to ensure fair pay and foster an inclusive culture. 

### üö® Why Fair Cash Matters
In many organizations, top executives are committed to avoiding sexism and ensuring positive CSR practices, but biases often sneak through at the middle management level. This is where promotion and pay decisions happen‚Äîand it‚Äôs where unconscious gender bias can unfairly impact women‚Äôs salaries and career growth. **Fair Cash** is here to change that.

It‚Äôs time for companies to gain clarity on their gender pay gaps and take action with data-driven insights. Let‚Äôs make pay equity not just a goal‚Äîbut a reality.

### üõ†Ô∏è What Is Fair Cash?

Fair Cash uses cutting-edge tech to measure, predict, and analyze pay equity within your company. Here‚Äôs how it works:

- **Employee Onboarding**: Add your employees through an easy registration process, collecting vital information (salary, designation, work hours, GitHub profile, etc.).
- **Peer Feedback**: Using a fun, Tinder-style feed, employees review their colleagues, upvoting, downvoting, and providing qualitative feedback.
