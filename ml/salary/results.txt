Important Considerations:

Performance and Contributions:  The salary estimates above do not account for individual performance, contributions to company growth, or other factors that might lead to a salary increase beyond the average for the role.
Stock Options: YC-backed companies often offer stock options as part of compensation. These can potentially be very valuable, but their worth depends on the company's future success.
Negotiation: Salaries are not always fixed. Employees should be prepared to negotiate their salary based on their experience, skills, and market value. 

Recommendation:

It's best to consult with a compensation expert who specializes in the tech industry in India for more precise salary predictions.  Consider factors like the company's financial health, growth stage, and specific role requirements for a more accurate estimate.
