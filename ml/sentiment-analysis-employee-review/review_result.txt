"Here are 5 key terms that describe the employee based on the review, along with explanations:\n\n1. **Technical Expertise:** This is clearly a strength. The employee is described as a \"wizard with data,\" having \"deep dive into data,\" \"attention to detail,\" and \"proactive about data.\" However, this expertise can sometimes overshadow other important aspects.\n\n2. **Lack of Collaboration:** The employee is often criticized for working in a \"silo\" and not collaborating enough with other teams, especially frontend and backend.  There's a need for \"better collaboration\" and \"more upfront communication\" to integrate data models effectively.\n\n3. **Focus on Technical Detail:** The employee tends to get lost in the technical details and misses the bigger picture. There's a lack of understanding about \"user interaction,\" \"UI expectations,\" and \"business implications\" of the data analysis.\n\n4. **Limited Deployment and Scalability Awareness:**  While the employee excels at data infrastructure, they need to improve their understanding of deployment, scaling, and system-level constraints. Deployments are \"challenging,\" models need \"tuning,\" and there's a lack of awareness of \"server limitations.\"\n\n5. **Security Awareness:**  The employee shows good understanding of data security, but sometimes there's \"lack of awareness about potential vulnerabilities\" and \"not enough thought put into securing the data pipeline.\"  More collaboration with security teams is needed. \n"
